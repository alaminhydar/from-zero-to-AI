# 🧠 Zero to AI

_A structured journey into Artificial Intelligence — from core data handling tools to deep learning._

I'm currently learning AI from the ground up and documenting my progress in this repository. This roadmap is split into 4 clear phases to guide me from data wrangling to machine learning, applied AI, and eventually deep learning.

## 📍 Learning Roadmap

### 📊 PHASE 1 — Data Handling & Visualization
Learn tools for working with, transforming, and visualizing datasets.

- [ ] NumPy
- [ ] Pandas
- [ ] Matplotlib & Seaborn
- [ ] Plotly / Cufflinks
- [ ] Geo Plotting (optional)
- [ ] **Capstone**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) + Visual Report

---

### 🤖 PHASE 2 — Core Machine Learning Algorithms
Gain foundational understanding of key ML models and how to evaluate them.

- [ ] Linear Regression
- [ ] Logistic Regression
- [ ] K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- [ ] Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- [ ] Decision Trees
- [ ] Random Forest
- [ ] K-Means Clustering
- [ ] Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- [ ] **Capstone**: Compare models on real-world dataset

---

### 💡 PHASE 3 — Applied Machine Learning
Apply ML in realistic, practical scenarios using advanced tools.

- [ ] Recommender Systems
- [ ] Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- [ ] Big Data with Apache Spark
- [ ] **Capstone**: Build an NLP or Recommendation App

---

### 🧠 PHASE 4 — Deep Learning (Intro)
Step into the world of neural networks and representation learning.

- [ ] Neural Network Basics
- [ ] TensorFlow / PyTorch (TBD)
- [ ] More content to be added as I progress...
